	<h3>Who is this guy?</h3>
	<p>First of all I'd like to thank you for visiting my small corner of the internet. My name is Ethan Hedrick. I live in Columbus, OH. In general I'm a software developer tinkerer. What do I mean by that? Well software development changes at such a fast pace and there's always something new to learn, or even something old to learn that you've never heard before. This is what I love about this field, and why I am so passionate about it.</p>
	<p>I am a Java developer by day, but by night I tend to follow more alternative routes (I'm looking at you Ruby). Other technologies I love include: SASS, JQuery, Angular.js, node.js, etc. I am a huge supporter of agile software development, and TDD/BDD. I have spent extensive amounts of time using Cucumber to show both product owners and development teams the virtues of BDD.</p>
